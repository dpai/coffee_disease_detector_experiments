# coffee_disease_detector_experiments

The README file will be an active document recording the updates. Eventually I will have a proper writeup.

The plan for this repository is to try out various experiments with the coffee disease detector model.

The goal is not to come up with a solution but to use various tools available for ML and DL development and use this project as a anchor project to try these tools.

First I will be using this project for ML experiment tracking using Dagshub. I want to try and use the MLFlow instance to track experiments and parameters as I run new experiments.

Some possible experiments that I will be trying is listed below:

1. Augment the data by increasing the number of positive and negative pairs for each class. 

2. Use SimCLR suggestions for augmenting the dataset.

3. Try different contrastive functions.

More to come soon.
